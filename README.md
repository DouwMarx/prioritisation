* Inspired by https://genuary.art/
* Built using https://processing.org/
* Possible interpretation:
   * Prioritisation matters
   * x-axis: Impact/Utility
   * y-axis: Time/Resources
   * Black prioritises, Blue does not
   * Large difference in total impact (x) for the same allowed time/resource budget (y).
